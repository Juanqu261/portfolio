# Adagioz & Harmonie Frontend

This is the Angular 19 frontend application for the Adagioz & Harmonie luxury fragrance catalog. It serves as an ultra-premium, editorial-style showcase designed to capture the essence of a high-end reseller boutique.

## Architectural & Style Election

The design direction follows the **"Flacon Brut" (Modern Avant-Garde)** concept to evoke an exclusive luxury feel. 
Key design pillars include:

*   **Color Protocol (60-30-10 Dark Mode)**:
    *   **60% Charcoal Foundation**: `#121212` / `#1A1A1A` for deep, mysterious backgrounds.
    *   **30% Deep Purple**: Base `#2B1B3D`, Glow `#4A2D6B`, Light `#6B3FA0` — used for backgrounds, borders, and icons respectively.
    *   **10% Brushed Silver**: `#E5E4E2` for sharp, architectural text styling and structural accents.
*   **Typography**: A mix of *Cormorant Garamond* (massive, italicized headers) and *Outfit* (clean, legible body copy).
*   **Animations**: Powered by **GSAP** (GreenSock) and ScrollTrigger to deliver slow, elegant cinematic fade-ins and staggered scroll reveals.
*   **Styling**: Customized raw CSS paired with Tailwind CSS utilities.

## Site Configuration (`public/site.config.json`)

A single JSON file drives all merchandising across the application. Editing this file controls:

*   **`spottedProduct`**: The product slug shown as the hero spotlight on the home page.
*   **`catalogRecommendations`**: An array of up to 10 product slugs displayed in the Catalog "open book" view.
*   **`collections`**: An array of collection objects (slug, name, description, products). Adding or removing an entry creates or removes the corresponding collection view entirely.

Product slugs in this config must match the `formatNameForUrl()` output (lowercase, hyphenated) of the actual product names from the backend.

## Core Features & Components

This application operates strictly under a **"Catalog Mode"** business rule. Direct sales are not handled natively; instead, users are seamlessly funneled to official external boutique endpoints via safe, SEO-friendly routing (`/products/:name`).

Important modules include:

*   **`HomeComponent`**: Landing page with brand presentation and a **spotted product** hero section driven by `site.config.json`.
*   **`CollectionListComponent`** (`/collections`): Displays a grid of collection cards read from the JSON config. Each card links to `/collections/:slug`.
*   **`CollectionDetailComponent`** (`/collections/:slug`): Individual collection page showing only the products assigned to that collection in the config. Redirects to `/collections` if the slug doesn't exist in the JSON.
*   **`CatalogComponent`** (`/catalog`): The "open book" curated showcase displaying up to 10 recommended products from `catalogRecommendations`.
*   **`ProductDetailComponent` (PDP)**: A deep-dive experience utilizing an "Extreme Tension" layout. The flacon image is pinned to the screen while editorial copy scrolls. Includes visual representations of the fragrance's distinct Olfactory Structure (Top, Heart, and Base notes).
*   **`NavbarComponent` / `FooterComponent`** *(shared)*: Both are standalone components mounted globally in `app.component.html`, above and below the `<router-outlet>`. They persist across all routes — do **not** add them to individual page templates.

## Key Implementation Decisions

*   **Product routing** uses `/products/:name` (SEO-friendly slugs). The PDP does **not** call a backend search endpoint. Instead, it fetches a batch of products and maps the URL slug to the correct product in-memory via `formatNameForUrl(product.name)`. This is intentional — the backend search had lossy string matching.
*   **Config-driven views**: Collections, catalog recommendations, and the spotted product are all managed through `src/assets/site.config.json`. The `SiteConfigService` loads and caches this config as Angular signals.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Note: The backend API must be running concurrently to serve catalog data.
